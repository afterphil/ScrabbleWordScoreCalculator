## How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).  
2. Run the `main.py` file.  
3. Follow the input prompts inside the IDE’s console/output window.

## Technical Notes

- The project uses a dictionary-based approach to map letters to point values.
- Multipliers (double/triple words, and in-progress letter multipliers) are applied by helper functions in `scoring_utils.py`.
- Input is automatically converted to uppercase before scoring.

## Future Improvements (Planned Ideas)

- Finish proper double and triple **letter** scoring  
- Add a command-line interface (CLI)  
- Prevent or sanitize non-letter characters  
- Support scoring multiple words (phrases)  
- Add automated tests  
- Add examples and better usage documentation  

## Purpose

This is a learning-focused project intended to practice:
- Python fundamentals  
- Modular code design  
- Working with functions and simple game logic
